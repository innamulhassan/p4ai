# Pattern 1: LLM + Tools

This foundational pattern enables the LLM to evolve from a probabilistic text generator into a reliable planner and router for action.

## Key Concepts

**Role of the LLM:** Acts as an intelligent intermediary — interpreting user intent, selecting the appropriate tool (function).

**Practical Benefit:** Provides deterministic capabilities (e.g., performing calculations or writing to a database) and access to real-time data, overcoming the LLM's static knowledge cutoff.

## Implementation Examples

This folder will contain practical implementations of the LLM + Tools pattern.

## Use Cases

- Function calling with APIs
- Database operations
- Mathematical calculations
- File system operations
- Real-time data retrieval
