# Pattern 4: LLM + Agent + MCP

This advanced pattern combines the planning intelligence of Agents with the standardized remote access of MCP for large-scale, distributed operations.

## Key Concepts

**Role of the LLM Agent:** The central Agent (Host/Orchestrator) uses MCP as its primary standardized mechanism to access and utilize a network of geographically or logically distributed tools and resources.

**Practical Benefit:** Enables agents to operate reliably across hybrid environments. The agent's core logic remains stable while the underlying distributed infrastructure — including diverse data sources, databases, and secure environments — is accessed consistently via the MCP Server network. This supports complex workflows requiring standardized execution across a distributed toolchain.
